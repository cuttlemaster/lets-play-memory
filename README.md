# lets-play-memory

My development team does quarterly showcases where we build small projects with the intent of learning something new along the way we can share with the team and improve our own skills and spread around interesting and helpful learnings. For the Q1 2020 showcase I decided to make a simply memory game like I used to play as a kid. The kind where you pick two tiles and if they match they get removed from the board and if they don't match the turn back over and you try again until you've found all of the matches.

## Intended Functionality
* User can choose a type of tile for their game (different illustrations)
* User can choose the size of their game (4x4 or 6x6)
* User can play the game to completion

## Desired Skills Development
* Continued strengthening of vanilla javascript skills (being in management has left them rusty)
* Learning how to properly shuffle an array (Field-Yates algorithm)
* Attempt some CSS animations when tiles are chosen

### Developmet Instructions
* When developing locally, run `npm run scss` to ensure styles are compiled as changes are made.
